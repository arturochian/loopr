This package contains a flexible framework for extending the pipe into a loop. This allows a basic strategy of focusing on a certain aspect of the data frame, make some changes, and then reincorporate these changes into the original data frame.

Install with
`devtools::install_github("bramtayl/loopr")`

See vignette for package details.
